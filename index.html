<p>DENISE BIBRO FINE ART is pleased to announce an exhibition of Danny Morgan’s paintings, Symbiotic: Form & Color, in
  its
  Gallery II space, September 6 – October 6, 2018.</p>

<p>Morgan, originally from Kentucky, has spent most of his life in Cincinnati and Florida as a successful artist and
  musician. Prior to becoming a professional at both; he received a degree for art at Kentucky University and
  subsequently taught art. His calling for music and art beckoned him to create his own unique and individual path.
  After
  having his own successful band and playing with the infamous Beach Boys he settled his roots in Sanibel, Florida.</p>

<p>Danny Morgan's work is full of cords of color, like the music he loves and plays. He is inspired by the beat and
  temper
  of music as well as the nature that surrounds him. His palette is primarily light and airy. His compositions are
  often
  comprised of juxtapositioned areas of color. The nuances and trajectory of his compositions are refined by various
  stylized brush strokes. All of his works resonate a fine sense of place, time and experience.</p>

<p>Morgan's mission is not to dictate the meaning of the chords in his compositions, but is to create a colorful,
  visceral
  scored experience for the viewer. His paintings depict transitional space between music and color coming together
  into
  visual form. The viewer interprets his or her own intellectual, emotional, and visceral response to each work.</p>

<p>This will be Danny Morgan's third solo exhibition at Denise Bibro Fine Art. He has had several shows in Florida and
  most recently had a one man show at the Indian Hill Gallery in Cincinnati, Ohio. He has also taught Fine Arts in
  Ohio.</p>
